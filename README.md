# intellij-exclude-indexing

Simple plugin for excluding indexing JavaScript files per project.

There are three dirrent ways supported:

- Excluding minified files
- Excluding JavaScript at all (similar to removing ".js" extension for JavaScript file type)
- Disabling index creating for JavaScript files (highlighting is working, but a lot of smart features are not available)
